# Decision-tree-for-classifying-heart-disease

A program that uses the decision trees for classifying heart disease with heart dataset to train and test the model. 

Selecting the best featurs by "Gini" and we mention why in " GiniAndEntropy.ipynb "
Also we deal with the overfitting issue by two technique 
1- Pre-Pruning
2- Post-Pruning
It was solved by the post-pruning and we mentioned in " Pre_PostPurning.ipynb " the difference between them and why we chose post-pruning.
